###Gameplay  
>Core War is a programming game created by in which two, three or four battle programs (called "champion") compete for control of a virtual computer (called MARS : Memory Array Redcode Simulator).  
>These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly language called Redcode.  
>At the beginning of a game, each battle program is loaded into memory at a random location, after which each program executes one instruction in turn. The object of the game is to cause the processes of opposing programs to terminate (which happens if they stop beeing alive), leaving the victorious program in sole possession of the machine.  
>  
>The 42's Corewar project is built in three parts : Assembly, Virtual Machine and Champion.
